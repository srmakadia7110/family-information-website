"If I had an hour&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
to solve a problem&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
and my life depende&nbsp&nbsp<br>
on the solution&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
i would spend&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
the first 55 minutes&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
determining the proper&nbsp<br>
question to ask&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
for once i know&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
the proper question,&nbsp<br>
i could solve&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
the problem in less then<br> 
five minutes."&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
